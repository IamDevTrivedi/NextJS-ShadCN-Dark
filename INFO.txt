Note:
The 'server' folder within the Git repository serves as an ideal starting point for any backend project requiring authentication. It includes essential fields such as:
- firstName
- lastName
- email
- password

This 'server' folder constitutes a complete, standalone backend application with authentication capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated as the backend for any frontend project.
